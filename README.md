# wernberg
A test of Wernberg ~~compression~~ visualization.

## what it does so far
* Takes a genome
* Makes a png out of it, color-coded by base
    * A - red
    * C - Green
    * T - Blue
    * G - Yellow
    * N - Black

## what it might do later
* XOR-style comparison of two genomes
* Wernberg compression!
* Statistical analysis & pattern search
    
## example
Here's a generated image of chromosome #22, created using this wernberg program: (the genome is from [here](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/H_sapiens/Assembled_chromosomes/seq/) ).

There's quite a lot of N's at the top, so you'll have to scroll about 1/3 of the way down to see any nucleotide bases.
_It's also a 70 x 732323 file, so view it with good Internet access._
